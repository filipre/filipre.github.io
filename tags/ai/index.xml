I surveyed several distributed, asynchronous optimization algorithms, gave insights into their convergence theory and performed experiments on the &amp;ldquo;delayed&amp;rdquo; versions of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers algorithm (ADMM). You can find my thesis and its abstract below.

Abstract Recently, distributed optimization became more and more popular due to the increase in available training data and available computing power.</description></item><item><title>Generate Graphs Using GANs</title><link>https://filipre.github.io/posts/generate-graphs-using-gans/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://filipre.github.io/posts/generate-graphs-using-gans/</guid><description>During the winter semester 2018/2019, I did a &amp;ldquo;guided research&amp;rdquo; project with the Data Analytics and Machine Learning Group chair at TUM. Together with my advisors we modified one of their projects called NetGAN that generates graphs (networks) using Generative Adversarial Networks. You can find my report below.
