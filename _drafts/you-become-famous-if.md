*Blog post in progress*

Here is an incomplete list of open questions I randomly encounter. Some are well known, other are very specific.

## Computer Science

- $$\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{NP}$$?
    - https://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm

## Combinatorial Optimization

- LP optimization: Is there a polynomial-time algorithm that is bounded in $$m$$ and $$n$$ only (and not in the size of the input $$A \in \mathbb{Q}^{m \times n}$$, $$b \in \mathbb{Q}^m$$ and $$c \in \mathbb{Q}^n$$)
- Metric TSP: Is there a $$1.\overline{3}$$-approximation?
    - There is a $$1.5$$-approximation  [Christodes, 1976]
    - There isn't a $$\frac{123}{122}$$-approximation [Karpinski, Lampis, Schmied, 2013]
