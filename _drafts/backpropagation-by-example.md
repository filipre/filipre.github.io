*Todo: Think about better titles*

Goals:
- [ ] Derivations of
    - [ ] simple Softmax Classifier with l1 norm (forward-backward splitting reference)
    - [ ] simple neural network from stanford exam
    - [ ] Batch norm
    - [ ] convolutional layer (include how to calculate dimensions)
- [ ] Introduce Matrix Derivatives, Jacboian, ...
- [ ] how to vectorize computations (for efficency)
- [ ] computational graphs (interactive?)
    - [ ] include mnist10 example? (90%)
    - [ ] convolutional playground?
    - [ ]
